                        meticulously maintained paddocks, and private forest trails. Every element of our architecture
                        and landscape has been designed with the primary objective of ensuring the comfort, safety, and
                        psychological well-being of our equine partners.</p>

                        to learning and listening. At PURAVI, we don't just teach people how to ride; we teach them how
                        to understand the language of the horse, fostering a partnership that extends far beyond the
                        arena's edge.</p>

                        ancient wisdom of classical horsemanship merges seamlessly with modern sports science. We
                        envision a future where every rider at PURAVI serves as an ambassador for ethical equine
                        treatment, demonstrating that competitive success and profound compassion are not mutually
                        exclusive but are, in fact, complementary forces.</p>
                    <p class="about-text">We strive to lead the industry in sustainable stable management and
                        welfare-oriented training, setting a gold standard for equestrian facilities worldwide. Our

                    PURAVI began over two decades ago with a single horse and a dream to create a different kind of
                    stable—one where the horse was more than an asset, but a true partner. Founded by the Miranda family
                    in 1998, PURAVI has grown from a private training ground into Portugal's most respected equestrian
                    academy.</p>
                <p class="about-text" style="margin-top: 2rem;">In our early years, we focused on restoring the local
                    land, ensuring that the natural trails of Puravi remained accessible for riders while protecting the
                    delicate mountain ecosystem. By 2005, we introduced our first youth development program, which has
                    since produced several national champions. Over the years, we have hosted numerous international
                    clinics, bringing the world's most innovative trainers to our hills. Today, PURAVI stands as a
                    testament to twenty-five years of dedication, surviving economic shifts and industry changes by
                    never wavering from our core value: the well-being of the horse.</p>

                        Warmbloods and gentle school ponies. Each horse is considered an individual, with a custom
                        training and care regimen designed to support their unique physical and emotional needs.</p>
                    <p class="about-text">Our commitment to our horses extends for their entire lives. Many of our

                        the lush pastures they have earned. We believe that a horse who is well-rested, well-fed, and
                        mentally engaged will always be a superior partner in the arena. Our horses aren't just animals;
                        they are the heart of everything we do.</p>

                    PURAVI, we don't just build riders; we build a community that shares a lifelong passion for the
                    equine spirit."</p>
                <p class="about-text" style="margin-top: 2rem;">Growth at our stable is measured not just in ribbons and
                    trophies, but in the deepening of character. We take immense pride in seeing our students develop
                    responsibility, empathy, and resilience through their work with the horses. Our community extends
                    beyond the lesson hours, with regular social gatherings, educational seminars, and off-site
                    excursions that bring our members closer together.</p>
                <p class="about-text">We are also deeply committed to the growth of Puravi itself. We actively support
                    local conservation efforts and provide employment and training opportunities for local youth
                    interested in equestrian careers. Being part of PURAVI means being part of a larger ecosystem of
                    care—one that respects the past, celebrates the present, and builds a sustainable future for the
                    horse and the community alike. We invite you to grow with us, to learn from us, and to become a part
                    of our enduring legacy.</p>
